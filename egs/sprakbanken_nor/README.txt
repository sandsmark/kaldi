This is based on the NST Norwegian ASR Database (DC identifier sbr-13):
https://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/ressurskatalog/oai-nb-no-sbr-13/

It is published under the CC-0 Public Domain license.

It consists of 97.5GB audio files for training and 26.9GB for testing. The
training data consists of 312 lines, by 900 different persons in 280 800
recordings. The testing data contains 987 lines by 80 persons in 78 960
different recordings.

There is one audio file per line in the manuscript which is one-to-one with the
recording.

The recordings are of people in the age range of 18-70. There is no exact data
on the distribution of genders, but it is not significantly biased. The number
of recordings with different dialects was selected primarily by linguistic
considerations and secondarily statistical and socio-economic conditions.


This recipe is based on the Danish and Swedish recipies. In total you will need

Origin of the data:

This corpus is part of a set of corpora for various linguistic purposes in
Norwegian, Danish and Swedish originally collected by Nordisk Spr√•kteknology
Holding AS.

NST went bankrupt in 2003, and in 2006 a consortium consisting of the
University of Oslo, the University of Bergen, the Norwegian University of
Technology and Science, the Language Council of Norway and IBM bought the
bankruptcy estate.

In 2009 the National Library of Norway was tasked by the Norwegian Ministry of
Culture with building a Norwegian language bank, and the work on this started in 2010.

In May 2011 the corpora from NST were transferred to the National Library of
Norway, whom published it as a part of the language bank.
